# compare-pytket-coverage old_cov_file new_cov_file
#
# where each file is a coverage xml file as generated by `pytest` with
# the `--cov-report=xml` option
#
# Returns status 0 if the coverage from `new_cov_file` is at least as good as
# `old_cov_file`. This tool will compare both the "lines" and "branch"
# scores. For comparing the "branch" scores, the `pytest` command should have
# included the `--cov-branch` option.
