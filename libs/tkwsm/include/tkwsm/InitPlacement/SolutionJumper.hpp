  /* What happens when we currently have PV->TV, and we want to reassign
    PV->TV'? Assuming that TV, TV' are different (otherwise there is no
    change to make), there are THREE possible cases:

    Case A (the usual case, "independent"): there is currently another PV'
        with PV'->TV', but there is NO edge PV--PV'.
        Thus, our trial jump will actually consist of a swap:
        PV->TV' and PV'->TV, and then the old and new scalar product
        contributions for PV, PV' don't affect each other.

    Case B ("empty image"): currently, there is NO p-vertex assigned to TV'.
        This can be viewed as the same as case A, if we invent a new isolated
        dummy vertex PV' with PV'->TV' currently: because it is isolated,
        it will never have a nonzero scalar product contribution.

    Case C ("dependent"): there is currently another PV'
        with PV'->TV', but the edge PV--PV' DOES exist.
        This is like Case A, but we have to be careful: after the trial jump
        PV->TV' and PV'->TV, BOTH new contributions would include the SAME
        contribution from the edge PV--PV'.
        This is not a problem, we just have to take it into account.

        Notice that if we subtract the CURRENT contributions from PV, PV'
        and then add the NEW contributions, the contribution from edge PV--PV'
        (i.e., weight(PV, PV') * weight(TV, TV'), the same before AND after
        the jump) is subtracted twice,
        then added twice.
        So the net effect is the same as if PV--PV' did not exist,
        so we don't need to do anything other than calculate
        the NEW contributions correctly.
