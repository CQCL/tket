 *
 * Otherwise, returns a crude upper bound. Of course, no way to know
 * the ACTUAL largest possible value without solving the WSM problem.
 *
 * @param pattern_ndata Data about the pattern graph.
 * @param explicit_target_ndata Data about the EXPLICIT target graph.
 * @param implicit_target_weight For each (v1,v2) of distinct target vertices,
 * if the edge is not mentioned in the EXPLICIT target graph, then it is taken
 * to exist, with this edge weight.
 * @param extra_safety_factor When converting unsigned to signed int types, we
 * want the unsigned value to fit within the signed value. So require that
 * multiplying by this extra factor still does not overflow.
 * @return A guaranteed upper bound for the scalar product (but maybe far too
 * big). Throws if it cannot get such a bound.
