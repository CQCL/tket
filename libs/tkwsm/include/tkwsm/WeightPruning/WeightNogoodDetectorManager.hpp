/** The basic idea is simple: during a search, if:
 * (1) we can QUICKLY calculate
 * a guaranteed lower bound on the additional scalar product which would
 * arise if the partial solution were to be completed, WHATEVER new
 * assignments are made; and if
 * (2) that would make the final scalar product larger than in the current
 * best solution;
 * ...THEN we can prune the search, and hence save a lot of time.
 *
 * The PROBLEM is: if (2) doesn't hold, then all of this calculation
 * is pointless. (1) is quite fast, but not free.
 *
 * Thus, we wrap within ANOTHER estimator (this class); we estimate
 * (very quickly) the lower bound roughly, and only if it seems likely
 * to detect a nogood do we actually do the calculation.
 *
 * Uses simple heuristics and feedback control to decide
 * when to activate the weight nogood detector,
 * and when to skip (trying to guess if the extra calculation
 * is worth it).
 *
 * It doesn't try to TIME or estimate AMOUNT of calculation
 * by the detector, or use fancy graph theory. It doesn't really
 * know anything about detection itself.
 * It just looks at results: a calculation was done, and a nogood
 * detected or not.
 * If not, we know by how much the lower bound fell short
 * of the required amount, so we can have "OK" or "bad" failures.
 *
 * Detecting a nogood is a SUCCESS; it prunes, and we ASSUME
 * that the time saved by pruning is more than the time spent calculating
 * to detect the nogood originally.
 *
 * Not detecting a nogood is a FAILURE. We spent time calculating,
 * looking for a nogood but not detecting one (whether or not
 * it really is a nogood; we just don't know at this stage).
 *
 * Really, almost ALL calculations (looking for node reduction,
 * nogood detection, etc. etc.) should be wrapped inside a manager object.
 * It would be great to have a general AI-type manager with a few simple
 * adjustable (or self-adjusting!) parameters to control such things
 * automatically; but that's probably very hard to do well.
