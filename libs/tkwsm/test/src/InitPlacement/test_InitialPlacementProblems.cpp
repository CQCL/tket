// These tests also record some results found with try_random_placements

// but I haven't bothered to update them.
// No point really; there's still plenty of experimentation to be done.
// This is more of a proof-of-concept that the WSM approach CAN give good
// solutions quickly).
//
// Results with binary trees are relatively faster, compared with IQP,
// than for square grids; but this is not surprising.
// There are several possibilities.
//
// (1) Path finding in binary trees is simpler than for square grids,
//    so maybe try_random_placements just churns through more choices.
//
// (2) Maybe the IQP from WSM approach is just inherently
//    not as good for trees as it is for square grids.
//
// (3) Maybe the MCCT parameters are just not tweaked very well.
//
// Results for square grids seem very good; for binary trees, not so good.
// But there's a lot of extra testing and experimentation to be done!
// Finding good default parameters, and maybe a better strategy for
// reintroducing deleted target edges, should give much better results.
//
// Not enough data for a clear conclusion; need more experiments!
