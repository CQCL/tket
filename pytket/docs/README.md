Pytket Docs

This builds the main pages of the pytket documentation site and the API reference. The user manual and examples are maintained in the [pytket-docs](https://github.com/CQCL/pytket-docs/) repository, and docs for each extension is maintained in the corresponding repository.

All documentation pages are written in [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org) and built with sphinx using the [MyST parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), with code cells supported through [myst-nb](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Clone repository

```
git clone git@github.com:CQCL/tket.git --recurse-submodules
```

# Move to docs directory

```
cd pytket/docs
```

# Option 1 - Justfile

The steps outlined below can be performed with the [just command runner](https://github.com/casey/just).

## Install (requires a [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installation).

(use `just install-dev` to install a develop wheel of pytket)

```shell
just install
```

use `just install-dev` to install a develop wheel of pytket

## Build the html

```shell
just build
```

## Serve the html (requires npm to be installed)

```shell
just serve
```

## Cleanup

To clean up the files generated by the docs build, run

```shell
just clean
```

# Option 2 - Without Justfile


## Install Python dependencies

```shell
poetry install
```

## Install pytket

The pytket package is not installed as a poetry dependency so needs to be installed separately

```shell
poetry run pip install -U pytket
```
You can install a pypi version as above or an editable wheel.

## Build html

```shell
poetry run bash ./build-docs.sh
```
## Serve built html locally

```shell
npx serve build
```
