# pytket docs

This builds the main pages of the pytket documentation site and the API reference. The user manual and examples are maintained in the [pytket-docs](https://github.com/CQCL/pytket-docs/) repository, and docs for each extension is maintained in the corresponding repository.

All documentation pages are written in [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org) and built with sphinx using the [MyST parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), with code cells supported through [myst-nb](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

```
git clone git@github.com:CQCL/tket.git --recurse-submodules

```

## Other commands

1. Link checking is done with `just-linkcheck`.
2. Running `just coverage` checks API docs coverage using the [sphinx.ext.coverage](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/coverage.html) extension.
3. The `just build-strict` combines the checks from (1.) and (2.). The `just-build` recipe is also used and Sphinx warnings are treated as errors.
