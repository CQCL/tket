pytket.qasm
==================================
:py:class:`Circuit` objects can be converted to and from OpenQASM, although we do not support all operations.
In particular, we do not currently support:

1) Importing from libraries other than "qelib1"
2) Ability to interpret gates acting on a whole register in the OpenQASM style

Any pytket :py:class:`Circuit` that is exported to this format should be valid for importing again as a :py:class:`Circuit`, making this a convenient file format
to save your :py:class:`Circuit` objects.

However, we do support symbolic parameters of gates, both on import and export.
