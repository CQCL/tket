pytket.qasm
==================================
:py:class:`Circuit` objects can be converted to and from OpenQASM, although we do not support all operations.

However, we do support symbolic parameters of gates, both on import and export.

Any pytket :py:class:`Circuit` that is exported to OpenQASM format with ``pytket.qasm`` should be valid for importing again as a :py:class:`Circuit`, making this a convenient file format
to save your :py:class:`Circuit` objects.

In addition to the default ``qelib1`` qasm header, the ``hqslib1`` header is also supported.
We can set the ``header`` argument in the qasm conversion functions as follows.

::
    
    from pytket.qasm import circuit_to_qasm_str

    qasm_str = circuit_to_qasm_str(circ, header="hqslib1")

.. note:: Unlike pytket backends, the qasm converters do not handle `implicit qubit permutations <https://cqcl.github.io/pytket/manual/manual_circuit.html#implicit-qubit-permutations>`_. In other words if a circuit containing an implicit qubit permutation is converted to a qasm file the implicit permutation will not be accounted for and the circuit will be missing this permutation when reimported.
