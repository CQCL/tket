    Squash sequences of two-qubit operations into minimal form.

    Pass to squash together sequences of single- and two-qubit gates into minimal form. Can decompose to TK2 or CX gates.

    Two-qubit operations can always be expressed in a minimal form of maximum three CXs, or as a single TK2 gate (a result also known as the KAK or Cartan decomposition).

    It is in general recommended to squash to TK2 gates, and to then use the `DecomposeTK2` pass for noise-aware decompositions to other gatesets. For backward compatibility, decompositions to CX are also supported. In this case, `cx_fidelity` can be provided to perform approximate decompositions to CX gates.

    When decomposing to TK2 gates, any sequence of two or more two-qubit gates on the same set of qubits are replaced by a single TK2 gate. When decomposing to CX, the substitution is only performed if it results in a reduction of the number of CX gates, or if at least one of the two-qubit gates is not a CX.

    Using the `allow_swaps=True` (default) option, qubits will be swapped when convenient to further reduce the two-qubit gate count (only applicable when decomposing to CX gates).

    We currently support `CX_fidelity`, `ZZMax_fidelity` and `ZZPhase_fidelity`. If provided, the `CX` and `ZZMax` fidelities must be given by a single floating point fidelity. The `ZZPhase` fidelity is given as a lambda float -> float, mapping a ZZPhase angle parameter to its fidelity, or by a single float. These parameters will be used to return the optimal decomposition of each TK2 gate, taking noise into consideration.

    If no fidelities are provided, the TK2 gates will be decomposed exactly using CX gates. For equal fidelities, ZZPhase will be preferred over ZZMax and CX if the decomposition results in fewer two-qubit gates.
