        The constructor for a GraphPlacement object. The Architecture object describes the connectivity between qubits. To find a qubit to node assignment, this method constructs a pattern graph where vertices are Circuit qubits and edges mean a pair of qubits have an interaction in the circuit, and then tries to find a weighted subgraph monomorphsim to the architecture connectivity, or target, graph. Edges in the pattern graph are weighted by the circuit depth at which the interaction between a pair of qubit occurs. The number of edges added to the pattern graph is effected by the maximum_pattern_gates and maximum_pattern_depth arguments. If no subgraph monomorphism can be found, lower edge weights are removed from the pattern graph, are more edges are added to the target graph. Edges added to the pattern graph are weighted lower to reflect what the distance between the Nodes they  are added between was on the original target graph.
