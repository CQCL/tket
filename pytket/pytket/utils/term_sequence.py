    Sequences the terms of a :py:class:`QubitPauliOperator` :math:`P` to generate
    a circuit approximating :math:`e^{i \\frac{\\pi}{2} P}`. This method
    performs Trotterisation on :math:`P` with a single Trotter step.

    This method uses a given partitioning strategy and a graph colouring
      method for term sequencing.

    The resulting Circuit will contain a sequence of CircBoxes. Each CircBox
    corresponds to a set of Pauli strings. Each exponentiated Pauli string
    in the set is realised as a PauliExpBox.

    The ordering of terms prioritises reducing the two qubit gate count of the
    circuit when the PauliSimp or GuidedPauliSimp passes are applied rather
    than minimising the trotter error.
