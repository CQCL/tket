  /**
   * Represents the stabiliser group for a Clifford process with qubit
   * initialisations/post-selections and mixed initialisations/discards.
   *
   * Based on the mixed stabiliser tableau representation of Audenaert & Pleino
   * 2005 (doi:10.1088/1367-2630/7/1/170), commonly used for representing a
   * stabilizer code in QEC. We make use of the Choi-Jamiolkovski isomorphism to
   * represent processes with inputs via the mixed tableau of their Choi state.
   *
   * Rows correspond to generators for the stabilizers of the mixed process,
   * i.e. Pauli measurements with expectation value 1. We will refer to these as
   * "coherent stabilizers" or "coherent subgroup". With mixed states, there may
   * exist additional Pauli operators which leave the state unchanged but do
   * have expectation value 0, which we will refer to as "decoherent
   * stabilizers" (i.e. the logical operators of the corresponding stabiliser
   * code). The extra generators for these are not stored since they can be
   * derived through commutation with the coherent subgroup. Similarly,
   * destabilisers (detectable errors) can be derived. A future implementation
   * may wish to always store the decoherent stabilizers and destabilisers for
   * faster updates.
   *
   * Each row is divided into its input segment and output segment. Under the CJ
   * isomorphism, a row RxS means (in matrix multiplication order) SCR^T = C.
   * When mapped to a sparse readable representation, independent
   * QubitPauliTensor objects are used for each segment, so we no longer expect
   * their individual phases to be +-1, instead only requiring this on their
   * product.
   *
   * Columns of the tableau are indexed by pair of Qubit id and a tag to
   * distinguish input vs output. Rows are not maintained in any particular
   * order, though the `gaussian_form()` method will bring it into row-reduced
   * echelon form.
