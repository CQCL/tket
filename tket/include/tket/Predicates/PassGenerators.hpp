 * @brief Squash sequences of two-qubit operations into minimal form.

 *
 * Two-qubit operations can always be expressed in a minimal form of
 * maximum three CXs, or as a single TK2 gate (a result also known
 * as the KAK or Cartan decomposition).
 *
 * It is in general recommended to squash to TK2 gates, and to then use the
 * `DecomposeTK2` pass for noise-aware decompositions to other gatesets.
 * For backward compatibility, decompositions to CX are also supported. In this
 * case, `cx_fidelity` can be provided to perform approximate decompositions to
 * CX.
 *
 * When decomposing to TK2 gates, any sequence of two or more two-qubit gates
 * on the same set of qubits are replaced by a single TK2 gate. When decomposing
 * to CX, the substitution is only performed if it results in a reduction of the
 * number of CX gates, or if at least one of the two-qubit gates is not a CX.
 *
 * Using the `allow_swaps=true` (default) option, qubits will be swapped when
 * convenient to further reduce the two-qubit gate count (only applicable
 * when decomposing to CX gates).
 *
 * @param target_2qb_gate OpType to decompose to. Either TK2 or CX.

 * decomposition, as measured using squared trace fidelity.
 * If no fidelities are provided, the TK2 gates will be decomposed
 * exactly using CX gates.
 *
 * All TK2(α, β, γ) gates must be normalised to the Weyl chamber, i.e.
 * 0.5 ≥ 𝛼 ≥ 𝛽 ≥ |𝛾|.
 *
 * Gate fidelities are passed as keyword arguments to perform noise-aware
 * decompositions. We currently support `CX_fidelity`, `ZZMax_fidelity` and

 * given by a single floating point fidelity. The `ZZPhase` fidelity is given as
 * a lambda float -> float, mapping a ZZPhase angle parameter to its fidelity.
 * These parameters will be used to return the optimal decomposition of each TK2
 * gate, taking noise into consideration.

 * Using the `allow_swaps=true` (default) option, qubits will be swapped when
 * convenient to reduce the two-qubit gate count of the decomposed TK2.
