/**
 * Class for compositional rewrites.
 * The broad structure is similar to the Transform class for Circuits.
 * Each rewrite is encapsulated by a single method `apply` which searches for
 * and performs all instances of a rewrite on a given diagram. The `apply`
 * method has an optional `Subdiagram` argument to operate locally on some
 * region of the diagram. This will also update the `Subdiagram` to use the new
 * vertices and edges. The `apply` method returns whether or not a rewrite was
 * performed. The main way to compose rewrites is in sequence or loops. Each
 * rewrite is expected to preserve global semantics of the diagram (or
 * restricted subdiagram) including global scalar.
 *
 * Previous designs used a separate method to identify independent matches from
 * performing the rewrite on a single match. This added extra complexity to the
 * structure, more reliance on users to be sensible, and reduced efficiency of
 * the rewrites. We decided that interactive rewriting was something we were
 * happy to go without as tket is not intended to be a proof assistant.
