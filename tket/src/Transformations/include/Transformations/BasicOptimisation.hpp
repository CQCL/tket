/**
 * @brief Squash sequences of two-qubit operations into minimal form.
 *
 * Squash together sequences of single- and two-qubit gates
 * into minimal form. Can decompose to TK2 or CX gates.
 *
 * Two-qubit operations can always be expressed in a minimal form of
 * maximum three CXs, or as a single TK2 gate (a result also known
 * as the KAK or Cartan decomposition).
 *
 * It is in general recommended to squash to TK2 gates, and to then use the
 * `DecomposeTK2` pass for noise-aware decompositions to other gatesets.
 * For backward compatibility, decompositions to CX are also supported. In this
 * case, `cx_fidelity` can be provided to perform approximate decompositions to
 * CX.
 *
 * When decomposing to TK2 gates, any sequence of two or more two-qubit gates
 * on the same set of qubits are replaced by a single TK2 gate. When decomposing
 * to CX, the substitution is only performed if it results in a reduction of the
 * number of CX gates, or if at least one of the two-qubit gates is not a CX.
 *
 * Using the `allow_swaps=true` (default) option, qubits will be swapped when
 * convenient to further reduce the two-qubit gate count (only applicable
 * when decomposing to CX gates).
 *
 * @param target_2qb_gate OpType to decompose to. Either TK2 or CX.
 * @param cx_fidelity Estimated CX gate fidelity, used when target_2qb_gate=CX.
 * @param allow_swaps Whether to allow implicit wire swaps.
 * @return Transform
